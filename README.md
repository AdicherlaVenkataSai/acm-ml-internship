Resource attributes
Since resources across the internet vary in terms of their pre-requisites and general accessibility, it is useful to give attributes to them so that it is easy to understand where a resource fits into the wider machine learning scope. Below is a few suggested attributes (please extend):

🌈 = creative
:bowtie: = beginner
😅 = intermediate, some pre-requisites
:godmode: = advanced, many pre-requisites
